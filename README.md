# Signal Processing in Electrochemistry with Python: Applications to the US Opioids Crisis

## Talk Details
**Event:** PyTexas 2025
**Date:** April 12, 2025  
**Location:** Austin, Texas  
**Link:** [PyOhio 2025 Talk](https://www.pytexas.org/2025/schedule/talks/#signal-processing-in-electrochemistry-with-python-applications-to-the-us-opioids-crisis)

## Description
This repository contains the scripts and data used in my talk at PyOhio 2025. The talk (available TBD) demonstrates how to use Python for signal processing in electrochemistry, which could represent an opportunity to help address the US opioids crisis. The work started as an appendix of my Master's Thesis, which is available [here](http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/46030/).
